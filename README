Introduction
============

Ether is an SCGI library for Ada.

This is the extension of the code I originally wrote for Jesse Lang's Solid
library. Now placed into it's own repository for anyone to use.

I have built this on the Debian testing.

Prerequisites
=============

* GNAT including gnatmake
* AWS
* XML/Ada

Configuration of a server
=========================

Hosts
-----

127.0.1.1	www.testscgi.org testscgi.org

Lighttpd
--------

In Debian testing:

Create the following: /etc/lighttpd/conf-available/10-scgi.conf

<start>
# /usr/share/doc/lighttpd/scgi.txt
# http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/lighttpd/wiki/Docs:ConfigurationOptions#mod_scgi-SCGI

server.modules += ( "mod_scgi" )
</end>

sudo /usr/sbin/lighty-enable-mod scgi

Add to the end of /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf:

<start>
$HTTP["host"] =~ "(^|www\.)testscgi.org" {
  server.document-root = "/home/laguest/public_html/testscgi.org"
  server.errorlog = "/var/log/lighttpd/testscgi.org.error.log"
  accesslog.filename = "/var/log/lighttpd/testscgi.org.access.log"

  scgi.server = ( "/" =>
    ( "127.0.1.1" =>
      (
        "host" => "127.0.1.1",
        "port" => 4000,
        "check-local" => "disable"
      )
    )
  )
}
<end>
